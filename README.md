## Why we need this
I've always found it annoying to constantly look for prices using the transfer market or online websites. This method saves time :stopwatch:.

## Price source
The prices are stored on a FUTPricer server. If the requested price is outdated, the FUTPricer server makes a request to one of several FUT websites (randomly, excluding down websites). The price is cached for 15 minutes. The app follows the accepted web scraping guidelines.

## Source code
I'd like to keep it private for now.
